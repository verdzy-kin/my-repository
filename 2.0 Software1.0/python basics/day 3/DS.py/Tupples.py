# Tuple Methods and Operations
# While you can't change tuples, you can still work with them in many ways:

# Sample tuple with some repeated values
grades = (85, 90, 78, 90, 92, 85, 88)

# Getting information about the tuple
print(f"Number of grades: {len(grades)}")
print(f"Highest grade: {max(grades)}")
print(f"Lowest grade: {min(grades)}")

# Counting occurrences
print(f"Number of 90s: {grades.count(90)}")
print(f"Number of 85s: {grades.count(85)}")

# Finding the position of an element
print(f"First occurrence of 90: {grades.index(90)}")

# Checking if an element exists
print(f"Is 95 in grades? {95 in grades}")
print(f"Is 85 in grades? {85 in grades}")

# Slicing works with tuples too
print(f"First three grades: {grades[:3]}")
print(f"Last three grades: {grades[-3:]}")
